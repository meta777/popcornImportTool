# popcornImportTool
A tool to help import .json points data from SideFX Houdini to PopcornFX

PopcornFX requires .json points data for Offline Simulations to have unique Id attributes for each point. Some point manipulations I wanted to do in Houdini break the attribute data so I fix my .json with this Python script. 

To use place the script in the directory with your .json files and run it. Requires Python 3.7.
